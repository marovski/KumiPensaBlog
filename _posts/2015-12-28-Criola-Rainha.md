_Cantora Caboverdiana, Kady_


Criola, daughter of the world and fruit of the cursed love Queen of the party and muse of the orchestra

Lady who loves, even when she who wants it, does not lend Woman with agile burns and body guitar Woman with warm blood and burning heart

Lady girl who shines, even when life does not bring wonders! Lady girl that their evils awe, even when in their presence, the devil sings!

Dance my criola, the moon is yours .. Dance with this beauty, that the sun wants you naked!

Criola, your life is hard and your struggle is ripe, in your lap my soul heals, and in your embrace, my body finds tenderness.

Ai Criolinha! That my eyes do not tire, of appreciating and loving ... Ai Criolinha! That my taste so much demands, this flavor the grouper stew, with a pinch of Mbongo!

Dance my criola, the moon is yours .. Dance with this beauty, that the sun wants you naked!
