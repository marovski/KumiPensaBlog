<p>Criola, daughter of the world
 and fruit of the cursed love!
Queen of the party and muse of the orchestra!</p>
</br>
<p>Lady who loves, even when who wants her, does not lend
Woman with agile burns and guitar body
Woman with warm blood and burning heart</p>
</br>
<p>Lady girl who shines, even when life does not bring wonders!
Lady girl that their evils awe, even when in their presence, the devil owls!</p>
</br>
<p>Dance my criola, the moon is yours .. 
Dance with this beauty, that the sun wants you exposed!</p>
</br>
<p>Criola, your life is hard and your struggle is ripe, 
  in your lap my soul heals, 
    and in your embrace, my body finds tenderness.</p>
</br>
<p>Ai Criolinha!</p>
<p>That my eyes do not tire, of appreciating and loving ...</p>
<p>Ai Criolinha!</p>
<p>That my taste so much demands, this flavor the grouper stew, with a pinch of Mbongo!</p>

</br>
<p>Dance my criola, the moon is yours .. </p>
<p>Dance with this beauty, that the sun wants you exposed!</p>
