<p>Criola, daughter of the world and fruit of the cursed love!</p>
<p>Queen of the party and muse of the orchestra!</p>

<p>Lady who loves, even when who wants her, does not lend</p>
<p>Woman with agile burns and guitar body</p>
<p>Woman with warm blood and burning heart</p>

<p>Lady girl who shines, even when life does not bring wonders!</p>
<p>Lady girl that their evils awe, even when in their presence, the devil owls!</p>

<p>Dance my criola, the moon is yours .. </p>
<p>Dance with this beauty, that the sun wants you exposed!</p>

<p>Criola, your life is hard and your struggle is ripe, 
  <p>in your lap my soul heals, </p>
    <p>and in your embrace, my body finds tenderness.</p>

<p>Ai Criolinha!</p>
<p>That my eyes do not tire, of appreciating and loving ...</p>
<p>Ai Criolinha!</p>
<p>That my taste so much demands, this flavor the grouper stew, with a pinch of Mbongo!</p>


<p>Dance my criola, the moon is yours .. </p>
<p>Dance with this beauty, that the sun wants you exposed!</p>
